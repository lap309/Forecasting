#Judgmental Forecasting
Used when there is a complete lack of historical data, data is unavailable at the given moment,  or during completely new and unique market conditions
- The launch of a new project
- New competitor enters the market
 <br>
There are 3 general ways that the judgment approach is utilized
-No data available and judgment forecasting is the only option <br>
-Data is available, statistical forecasts are generated, and then adjusted from the judgment approach <br>
-Data is available, statistical forecasts are generated independently, and then combined with judgment approach <br>
Statistical forecasts are generally superior to generating forecasts than using only judgment, but there are situations where both can play an important role. <br>
<br>
Judgment approach is highly subjective and can therefore be clouded by personal or political agendas, making it inconsistent. Judgment forecasting is also highly affected by anchoring, the case when the forecast tens to converge or be close to an initial/familiar reference point. This would enter a lot of systemic bias.
